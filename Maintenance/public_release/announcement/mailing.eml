Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.10
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

Besides fixes and general enhancement to existing packages, the following
has changed since CGALÂ 4.9:


* Installation

  - The minimum required version of CMake is now 3.1. All CMake versions up to
    3.7 are supported.


* Generalized Maps (new package)

  - This package implements Generalized Maps in d dimensions. A generalized map
    is a data structure enabling to represent an orientable or non orientable
    subdivided object by describing all the cells of the subdivision (for
    example in 3D vertices, edges, faces, volumes) and all the incidence and
    adjacency relationships between these cells. This data structure is the
    generalization of the combinatorial maps in order to be able to represent
    non orientable objects.


* 3D Point Set (new package)

  - This package provides a flexible data structure CGAL::Point_set_3 that
    allows the user to easily handle point sets with an arbitrary number of
    attributes (such as normal vectors, colors, labeling, etc.).


Note also that the advanced API of a few CGAL packages have change in an
incompatible way:
- Triangulated Surface Mesh Shortest Paths
- CGAL and the Boost Graph Library (BGL)
- 2D and 3D Linear Geometry Kernel
- 2D Triangulations
- 3D Triangulations

See http://www.cgal.org/2017/05/24/cgal410/ for a complete list of
changes. Breaking changes are highlighted with a bold "Breaking change".


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
